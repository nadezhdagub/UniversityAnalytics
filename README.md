# UniversityAnalytics project

The project examines two universities of the city of St. Petersburg for the analysis of the teaching staff, their scientific works, directions, popularity of directions and more. The analysis takes place by downloading the data with a parser and displaying graphs using the Qlik tool

There is a separate directory for the dataset and a separate one for the project.
